I build this NFT app with the thirdweb package, to write and deploy the contracts.

## Getting Started

This is an app that works with a smart contract deployed in mumbai testnet
1. To use it you can connect your wallet and claim a first stage pokemon (Charmander)
2. To evolve your pokemon you will need to have two of the first stage pokemons and you will get a second stage one (Charmeleon)
3. When you click evolve holdin 2 Charmanders you will get 1 Charmeleon :)
