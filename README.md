Deployed app:
https://poke-app-taupe-phi.vercel.app/

I build this NFT app with nextJS and css for the frontend and the thirdweb package, to write and deploy the contracts.

## Getting Started

This is an app that works with a smart contract deployed in Mumbai testnet
1. To use it you need to connect your wallet and claim a first stage pokemon (Charmander).
2. To evolve your pokemon you will need to have 2 of the first stage pokemons and they will evolve to a second stage one (Charmeleon).
3. When you click evolve holdin 2 Charmanders you will get 1 Charmeleon :)
